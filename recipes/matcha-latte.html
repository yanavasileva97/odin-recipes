    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons matcha powder</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons hot water</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
        <li>Milk of choice (I used almond milk)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
             <li>In a measuring cup or bowl, add the matcha powder. Pour in the 1 to 2 tablespoons of hot water and whisk until the matcha has fully incorporated into the water. This should create almost a bit of a paste.</li>
             <li>Pour in the remaining 1 cup of water and mix. Transfer to the fridge or freezer to chill for about 15 minutes.</li>
             <li>Fill two glasses full of ice and add your milk of choice so the glass is about 3/4 of the way full. If you like, this is a great time to add any simple syrup. Lastly, pour in the chilled matcha and stir.</li>
        </ol>
